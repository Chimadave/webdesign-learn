 	<p>Hello and welcome to my website: SdZ. <br /> What is the SdZ website?</p>

 	<h2>Training courses for beginners</h2>
 	<p>The SdZ website provides training courses (tutorials) for beginners: no knowledge is required to read these courses! </p>

 	<h2>An active community</h2>
 	<p>You have a problem or something in the course you don't understand ? You need help in creating your website? <br /> Visit the forums! You'll find that you're not alone in this and you'll certainly find someone who will kindly help solve that problem. </p>
